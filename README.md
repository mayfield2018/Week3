# Week3
After I forked the ProgrammingAssignment2 from rdpeng, I cannot have my ProgrammingAssignment here in GitHub. So I create this depository
for my assignment. It is for course week3. 

1. Copy the file makeVector.R from instructor's assignment.
2. Write my own makematrix.R to do the assignment.
